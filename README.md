This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java array iteration. The `Bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index. This results in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The solution, provided in `BugSolution.java`, corrects the loop condition to prevent the error.
